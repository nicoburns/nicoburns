## Hi there!

I'm Nico. A polyglot software developer based in London, UK.

#### Iâ€™m currently working on:

- [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) - a standalone layout library in Rust implementing the Flexbox and CSS Grid algorithms
- [Blessed.rs](https://blessed.rs) - a curated guide to the Rust ecosystem

### Examples of my work

If you are looking for examples of my work, then you may wish to look at the following:

  - The source code in the [`src/compute/grid`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/tree/main/src/compute/grid) directory is all mine
  - The 200+ associated [test fixtures](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/tree/main/test_fixtures) (those whose name begins with `grid`)
  - The [tracking issue](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/issues/204) for the CSS feature.
  - Some selected individual Pull Requests:

[**Knex.js**](https://github.com/knex/knex) | Query Builder (TypeScript) | 2022
- My [PR to add UPSERT support](https://github.com/knex/knex/pull/3763) to knex.js

[**GhostEdit**](https://github.com/nicoburns/ghostedit) | WYSIWYG Editor (JavaScript) | 2010
- [GhostEdit](https://github.com/nicoburns/ghostedit) - an open source WYSIWYG editor (but bear in mind that this was written way back in 2010, and was targeting IE6+ and thus was unable to use even ES5 features).
